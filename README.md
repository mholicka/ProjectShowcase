# ProjectShowcase

## Introduction

Here are projects that I have worked on in the past. Please note that lines are removed in some files, and some project files cannot be added due to privacy. I would like to use this repo as a showcase of my coding, documentation and presentation. Below is a short description of each project located in this repo.

## AgMonitor

- Done during my time at Agriculture and Agri-Foods Canada during Winter 2015/2016
- Purpose was to perform data comparison on an in-house raster dataset of resolution 5m x 5m to the LANDSAT data with resolution of 30m x 30m.
- Involved raster processing, outlier removal through the use of strict weighed linear regression.

## Route Optimizations

- Project done with members of the University of Waterloo Geospatial Club
- Proved that with route optimizations, time and distance can be reduced by 55% on average in an area of Waterloo.
- Presented at the 2016 IALEP conference.

## Soil Moisture

- Done during my second time at Agriculture and Agri-Foods Canada during Summer 2016.
- Documentation is found within the folder.
- Took soil moisture readings for North America and performed statistical calculations and created maps.
- This was redesigned from the ground up to ensure the process is more dynamic , have error checking, faster file processing, and feature seamless multi-year rollover.

## Web Modals

- Done during my Spring 2017 co-op.
- Geofence is the main one, which is a web-application to create geofences and routing for a building.
- Equipment Map Modal showed points on the map, which when clicked would give relevant information.
- Contract filter used Selectize.js to filter contractors as needed.
